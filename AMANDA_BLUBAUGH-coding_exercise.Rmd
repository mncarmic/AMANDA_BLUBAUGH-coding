#After viewing the extremely low p value for infant mortality as a predictor for life expectancy, and the extremely high p value for population as a predictor of life expectancy, as well as comparing both linear plots of these in the year 2000, it is safe to say that infant mortality rates in Africa were far more predictive of life expectancy than population.
